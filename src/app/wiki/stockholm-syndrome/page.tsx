        <p>Stockholm syndrome is a phenomenon where a person develops affection or bond with their abuser. Interestingly enough, Stockholm is actually the capital city of Sweden. So why was this psychological condition named after it?</p>

        <h1 className='header'>Discovery</h1>

        <p>This syndrome is named in connection with a famous bank robbery in Stockholm known as the Norrmalmstorg Robbery that took place from <strong>Aug 23, 1973 – Aug 28, 1973</strong>. During this time employees of the bank were held hostage. To cut the long story short, the robbers were caught and the hostages were freed but what was unusual was the fact that the hostages actually <strong>refused to testify against the robbers</strong> who had held them captive but instead actually became affectionate towards them and even defended the robbers. Thus this syndrome was named the Stockholm Syndrome.</p>

        <h1 className='header'>Further Explanation</h1>
        
        <p>Stockholm syndrome is an emotional and mental response to abuse in which a victim of abuse, in the context, develops sympathy for the person who abused them. In the victim's mind, the brain does this in order to cope with fear, pain and trauma. As they develop affection for the abuser, they begin to appreciate even the slightest show of kindness from their perpetuator, create a view where their happiness is linked to their abusers happiness and become protective towards them.</p>

        <h1 className='header'>Problems</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>This obviously can get in the way of a victim reporting the abuse or testifying against the abused making it more difficult for the abuser to have charges brought against them</li>
          <li>Messes with the mind, a normal person would not be sympathetic towards someone who abuses them and as a result they might be stuck in an abuse cycle where the abuser can continue to torture and abuse them whether physically mentally or sexually which can take a toll on the abused health</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 className='header'>Causes</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Acts of kindness from abuser even the slightest acts like giving them a little water to drink</li>
          <li>Fear that the abuser has the potential to cause pain or hurt the victim but the abuser has not done anything to threaten the life of the abuser.</li>
          <li>Victim depends on the abuser for basic needs like food, water, shelter and the abuser has power over them etc. For example if a person could be abused maybe sexually or physically but because they depend on the abuser for survival to them the abuser is a sustainer and they see this as kindness.</li>
          <li>Victims share the same space with the abuser for a lengthy period of time, being abused. During this time the victim, being exposed to trauma or fear, will try to cope with this by developing a positive attitude towards the abuser</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 className='header' >Example</h1>
        <p>Victims of sexual abuse through sex trafficing for example virtually become dependent on their abusers or captors. Though their abusers might abuse them like force them to do sex work or sexually abuse them themselves because the victim depends on the abuser to stay alive anytime they show an act of kindness like giving something to eat or drink or not acting upon threats to kill them or threaten their life the casuality can interpret this as love and they can’t actually realize that the abuser needs them alive to keep exploiting them.</p>

        <h1 className='header' >Recovery</h1>
        <p>Though the stockholm syndrome is not actually a medical condition it is however a psychological one so therapy can help the victim to recover from the trauma they could have experienced and allow them to see abuse for what it is.</p>

        <h1 className='header' >Conclusion</h1>
