        <p>The way to stop abuse is to talk about it. If you or someone you know is being abused, it’s important for you to tell someone you trust. Trusting someone after you’ve been hurt can be hard to do, but there are people who will believe you and want to help you. If there is no one you can trust at home, talk to someone at school, like a teacher, counsellor, school nurse, coach, or a friend’s mom or dad. You should not keep the abuse a secret, even if the adult abusing you tells you that something bad will happen if you tell.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, the people you turn to may not want to believe that you have been abused. If you talk to someone who is not helpful or who tells you to forget about the abuse, don’t give up. Tell someone else, and keep telling until you get the help you need to feel safe.</p>
