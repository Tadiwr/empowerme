        <p>It's never easy to get past what happened to clear your mind off the memories of that time and get your life back on track but the fact that you're reading this proves that you're strong,stronger than you ever thought you were and above all brave.It takes courage to seek out for help and you have that and now it's time for you to heal and move on with your life . Knowing how important you are and of  how much significance you are to yourself and to the people around you.Noone but you can relate and know how much pain and mental disturbance you had to go through but you have to know that it will be okay and healing is an ongoing process that you have to undergo so as to get yourself back on track.It' time for you to reconnect with life and get back to doing the things that you love and that give you peace of mind. Before you see a therapist or a counsellor you have to start by healing yourself and how do you do that by acknowledging the fact that you're strong, brave, courageous, empowered, loved and can get through anything.</p>
        <br />

        <p> If you were not putting yourself first now is the time  to put yourself first and set your mind aside from that and just take time to take out that inner you that had forgotten how to be happy, smile and just not worry about taking a breath. Overall you should know that everything is going to be fine and that you were never wrong, you were never your fault, you never deserved it and you never will but what you do deserve is love care affection and a free mind and you can get that.It's now time to surround yourself with love, positive thoughts, positive energy, positive people and a positive environment.A Positive everything.Do some exercise oftenly so as to keep your mind free and visit places that you love to go and just take a  walk.Accept that it happened and you're not going back to that past situation, meditate and search for those moments that you were happy and embrace them.Talk about it.</p>

        <br />  
        <p>Join a support group where you can be able to meet and interact with those of you who have gone through the same as you and how they're taking it day by day. The best but hard way to heal Is to forgive, forgive them although it may seem outrageous and like they don't deserve your forgiveness you need to give it to them so that you let it go and you can heal your wounds. Don't bottle up your feelings let them flow and make sure you let it all out and start stuffing new and better thoughts and you can't do that if you still have bitterness and hatred from the past still stored and eating you from inside. Overall tell yourself that: </p>
        <br />

        <strong>I CAN</strong><br />
        <strong>I WILL</strong><br />
        <strong>I ALREADY HAVE</strong><br />

        <br />
        <p>and start the process day by day and don't rush it. You can do it.</p>
